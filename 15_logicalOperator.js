/**
 * lesson 15: Logical Operators
 * Logical operators are used to combine multiple boolean expressions or values.
 * They return a boolean value based on the evaluation of the expressions.
 * Common logical operators include AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!).
 * * AND (&&): Returns true if both operands are true.
 * * OR (||): Returns true if at least one operand is true.
 * * * NOT (!): Returns true if the operand is false, and false if the operand is true.
